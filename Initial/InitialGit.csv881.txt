    Use :ref:`string formatting` and :func:`~binascii.unhexlify` to
    convert ``val``, a :func:`long`, to a byte :func:`str`.

    :param long val: The value to pack

    :param str endianness: The endianness of the result. ``'big'`` for
      big-endian, ``'little'`` for little-endian.

    If you want byte- and word-ordering to differ, you're on your own.

    Using :ref:`string formatting` lets us use Python's C innards.

### Usage
### guid = SequentialGUID.NewSequentialGUID(SequentialGUID.SEQUENTIAL_GUID_AS_STRING)
### Use String for most dbs, and At End for MSSQL if you use their GUID field type
### REQUIRES: Python 2.6+ with bytearray support
